Express server (ESM) â€“ simple Node.js server to simulate Zoho webhook handling.

AI Drafting â€“ generates a contextual draft email using a mock LLM (can be swapped with OpenAI).

Zoho CRM-ready â€“ accepts incoming lead data in Zoho webhook format.

Future-ready â€“ designed for extension into OpenAI + Zoho Notes integration.

## ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack

Node.js + Express (ES Modules).

OpenAI API.

Zoho CRM REST APIs.

cd "to the main directory"
```

2. Install Dependencies

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

```

4. Start the server

```bash
node app.js
```

##  Example Flow

Step 1: Zoho CRM triggers webhook

Whenever a new Lead is created or updated in Zoho, it can send a webhook payload to your prototype server:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/zoho/webhook/lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "id": "1234567890",
      "full_name": "Asha Sharma",
      "interested_in": "Spikra CRM integration",
      "last_note": "Met at webinar"
    }
  }'
```

Step 2: Express server processes payload

Extracts full_name, interested_in, and last_note.

Sends prompt to OpenAI API to generate a contextual draft email.

Calls Zoho CRM API â†’ attaches that draft as a Note to the Lead.

Step 3: Response from server

Prototype server replies with JSON (draft + Zoho confirmation):
```bash
{
  "status": "ok",
  "lead_id": "1234567890",
  "draft": "Hi Asha Sharma,\n\nThanks for connecting. I saw you're interested in Spikra CRM integration. I'd love to discuss next steps.\n\nBest,\nSpikra Sales",
  "zoho_status": "Note created successfully"
}

```
